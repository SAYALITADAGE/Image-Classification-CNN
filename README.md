DESCRIPTION:
This project is part of Internship Task-3, where a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is developed for image classification using TensorFlow (Keras).

The objective of this task is to build a deep learning model that can automatically classify images into different categories by learning visual patterns such as edges, shapes, and textures.

The CIFAR-10 dataset is used for training and testing the model. It consists of 60,000 color images divided into 10 different classes. The dataset is split into training and test sets to evaluate the performance of the model on unseen data.

The CNN model is built using multiple convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and fully connected (dense) layers. The model is trained for several epochs, during which it gradually improves its accuracy. Model performance is evaluated using test accuracy, and learning behavior is visualized using accuracy graphs.

This project demonstrates the practical implementation of CNNs for image classification and highlights the effectiveness of deep learning techniques in computer vision tasks.
